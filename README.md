## 🚀 Using the Application

### Starting the Application

After installation, you can start the application using:

- **Windows**:
  - GUI: Double-click `run_gui.bat`
  - Console: Double-click `run_console.bat`

- **macOS/Linux**:
  - GUI: Open a terminal and run `./run_gui.sh`
  - Console: Open a terminal and run `./run_console.sh`

### GUI Interface

The GUI provides a user-friendly way to:
- Add and manage YouTube playlists
- Configure audio settings (format, bitrate, etc.)
- Download individual videos
- Update all tracked playlists at once

### Console Interface

The console provides more advanced functionality:

```bash
# Download a single video
run_console.bat --download "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Download a playlist
run_console.bat --download "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID"

# Add a playlist to track for updates
run_console.bat --add-playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID"

# List tracked playlists
run_console.bat --list-playlists

# Update all tracked playlists (download new videos)
run_console.bat --update-all
```

Replace `.bat` with `.sh` on macOS/Linux.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) to store settings. You can edit this through the GUI or directly in a text editor:

```ini
[general]
output_directory = data/audio  # Where audio files are saved
check_interval = 24            # Hours between checks for new videos
max_downloads = 10             # Max videos to download per run

[audio]
format = mp3                   # Audio format (mp3, wav, m4a, ogg)
bitrate = 192k                 # Audio quality
normalize_audio = True         # Balance volume levels
target_level = -18.0           # Target volume level in dB

[logging]
level = INFO                   # Log detail level
file = app.log                 # Log file location
console = True                 # Show logs in console
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg errors**: If audio conversion fails, ensure FFmpeg is installed correctly
- **Download errors**: Some videos may be restricted and cannot be downloaded
- **GUI doesn't start**: Ensure tkinter is installed with Python
- **Playlist errors**: Make sure playlist URLs are correct and playlists are not private
